Full Opaque Grass Physics & Wind - README  
--------------------------------------------------------------  

Overview  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
The Full Opaque Grass Physics & Wind package is a lightweight, stylized grass system designed for mobile, VR, and stylized projects.  
It delivers high-performance, fully opaque grass effects optimized for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP).  
This pack includes dynamic grass physics with wind simulation, mesh placement tools, ambient grass particles, and a demo scene.  

--------------------------------------------------------------  
Dynamic Grass Physics (Beta)  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
A physics-based interaction system is included to simulate grass reacting to moving targets (e.g., a player), creating trails in the grass as they move.  

Three shader options are available:  
- S_Vegetation_Interactive (with VFX_TargetPosition_5Point)  
  High-quality trail system using 5 points for smooth interaction.  

- S_Vegetation_Interactive_Simple (with VFX_TargetPosition_2Point)  
  Optimized version using 2 points for lower performance cost.  

- S_Vegetation  
  Lightweight version without any physics, ideal for distant grass or simpler setups.  

To use:  
1. Add the desired VFX_TargetPosition script (2Point or 5Point) to your player or moving object.  
2. Assign your player (or moving target) in the **Target** field in the script inspector. Limit to 1 Target.  
3. Apply the corresponding vegetation shader (Interactive or Simple) to your grass material.  

⚠️ This system is in beta. If you encounter issues, feel free to contact me.

Mesh Display Tool  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
The Mesh Display Tool allows you to manually paint grass directly on 3D mesh surfaces.  

How to Use:  
1. Select your mesh in the scene.  
2. Add the DisplayGrass Script  
3. Select the SM_Grass Prefab and adjust parameters such as density, size, and randomness.  
4. Generate.  

--------------------------------------------------------------  
Terrain Detail Mesh Setup (Unity 2022)  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
You can also use the grass prefab as a **detail mesh** on Unity terrains for precise placement.  

How to Add a Grass Detail Mesh to a Terrain in Unity 2022:  
1. Select your terrain object in the scene.  
2. In the Terrain Inspector, go to the **Paint Details** tab.  
3. Click on **Edit Details** → **Add Detail Mesh**.  
4. In the popup window:  
   - Assign the SM_Grass prefab as the Detail mesh.  
   - Set **Render Mode** to **Vertex Lit** or **Grass** depending on your desired style.  
   - Adjust settings like Min/Max Width & Height, and Noise Spread.  
5. Make sure to check the option **Align to Terrain** — this is important, as it ensures the grass follows the slope of the terrain.  
   The grass shader automatically adjusts color based on slope for a more natural visual effect.  
6. Use the terrain brush to paint grass exactly where you want it.

Wind Manager  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
The WindManager controls global wind direction and strength affecting all grass elements and VFX (like fireflies and floating grass).  

Customizable Parameters:  
- Wind Direction (Vector2): Controls wind direction on X and Y axes.  
- Wind Size (Float): Controls the size of the wind waves.  
- Wind Strength (Float): Determines how strongly grass is pushed.  
- Wind Speed (Float): Controls the speed at which wind moves.  

--------------------------------------------------------------  
Grass & Firefly VFX  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
Two ambient VFX systems are included in the package:  
- **Grass Particles VFX**  
- **Firefly Particles VFX**  

To use them, simply **drag and drop** the VFX prefab into your scene and **attach it to your player** or any moving object.  
These VFX are synchronized with the Wind Manager for natural ambient movement.
